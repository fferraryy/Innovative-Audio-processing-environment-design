## Moving average
To use moving average you can either conventionally compile the .c file to a .o and link with your project or you can use single file include. To do this add the following line `#define MOVING_AVERAGE_SINGLE_FILE_INCLUDE` before you include the library. Note do not add the hash define twice in your project.
