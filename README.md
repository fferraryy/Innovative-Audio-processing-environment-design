# Innovative Audio processing environment design
The aim of this project to perform an analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and facilitates the triggering of recording which is subsequently transmitted to a connected computer. Additionally, featuring the computer interface, which utilises a command-line interface (CLI) for user control. This allows for various audio filtering techniques and the function to save recordings.
